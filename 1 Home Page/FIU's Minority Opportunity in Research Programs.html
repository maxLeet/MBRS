      <p style="text-align:justify">The FIU Minority Opportunities in Research (MORE) Program began in 1985 and has grown to include the MBRS RISE, MBRS SCORE and MARC U*STAR Programs. The FIU SCORE Program assists FIU faculty in the preparation of grant proposals and provides administrative support post-award.  The RISE Program also promotes the involvement of undergraduate and graduate students in research by providing salaries for the students, tuition for graduate students, and travel funds for the students to attend scientific meetings. In a similar fashion, the MARC U*STAR Program focuses on Junior and Senior undergraduate students.  The students are involved in original research and, depending on their level, are expected to present their work at professional meetings and publish their results in research journals. The FIU MORE Program also enriches FIU by bringing prominent guest speakers to campus to meet with students, cosponsoring an annual symposium and providing a clearing house for students to learn about special training programs and career opportunities in biomedical research, such as NIH internships.<br /><br />  
        FIU offers, through a variety of academic programs, advanced study and research in the biomedical area at both the graduate and undergraduate levels. The Departments of Biological Sciences, Chemistry & Biochemistry, Physics, Computer & Information Sciences, Biomedical Engineering, Mechanical & Materials Engineering, Dietetics & Nutrition, Environmental Studies and Psychology all offer B.A., B.S., M.S. and Ph.D. programs, and there are also opportunities in the FIU College of Medicine and in the Robert Stempel College of Public Health & Social Work.<br /><br />
        So whether you are a faculty member interested in learning about NIH/NIGMS funding opportunities or a student interested in a career in biomedical research, chances are the FIU MORE Program has something for you!      </p>

<p style="text-align:center;">Modesto Maidique Campus, MARC Pavilion<br />
  11200 S.W. 8th Street, Miami, Florida 33199</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">On behalf of the symposium organizing committee, I would like to invite you to participate in the 15th Biomedical and Comparative Immunology Symposium in Miami, at Florida International University (FIU). This annual symposium will address recent advances in our understanding of diverse biological systems and phenomena. It will focus on cellular and molecular mechanisms of fundamental processes that govern organismal development, reproduction, cellular differentiation, disease, growth and survival. We anticipate that biologists and biomedical scientists working with a variety of vertebrate (including human and other mammals) and invertebrate organisms will find the plenary sessions and other scientific presentations informative and stimulating. Please share this invitation with your colleagues, post-doctoral fellows and students. We look forward to welcoming you to South Florida where we hope you will also enjoy the weather and the wealth of cultural diversity seen in the restaurants, museums, tropical gardens and shopping centers.</p>

<strong>BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH INITIATIVE (BRI)</strong><br />
<strong>2014 FIU STUDENT SUMMER RESEARCH AWARDS</strong><strong> </strong><br /></h2>
</p><br />
<p style="text-align:justify;">Mini-grants for FIU graduate and undergraduate students are available to fund student summer research awards in the biomedical sciences through a Program Development Award from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (MBRS RISE Program). Awards, up to $3000 each (with convincing budget justification) will be awarded for the summer of 2014. Selection of awardees will be based on scientific merit of the proposed project and the overall quality of the application. Applications will be reviewed and assessed according to the published criteria and ranked by external and internal reviewers. The funds are to be used for purchase of research supplies only and cannot be used for OPS wages, travel, equipment (costing $1000 or more), or books. Please note that funds are available for the purchase of scientific software (costing less than $1000) to be used in the laboratory only.  Graduate and undergraduate students, currently engaged in biomedical research are invited and encouraged to apply with a sponsorship letter from their research supervisor. To be eligible for an award a student must be enrolled in a degree program at FIU and be in residence during the summer and fall of 2014. Students who will be graduating in fall 2014 are not eligible unless they (or their research supervisor) can confirm that the project will be completed by the awardee and a report on the funded project will be presented by the student at the annual MARC U*STAR & MBRS RISE Student  Mini-Symposium in the fall (2014) or at the 2015 Biomedical and Comparative Immunology (BCI) Symposium (March 2015) since all award recipients are required to present their research at one or other symposia to meet the eligibility requirements of the award. The application form and instructions for submission are available electronically via email or may be obtained as hard copies from the MBRS office (OE 165).  All FIU students engaged in biomedical research are encouraged to apply.</p><br />
